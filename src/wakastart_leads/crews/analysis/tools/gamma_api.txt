Generate API parameters explained
How the the Generate API parameters influence your gamma. Read this before heading to the API Reference page.

The sample API requests below shows all required and optional API parameters, as well as sample responses.

Top level parameters
inputText (required)
Content used to generate your gamma, including text and image URLs.

Add images to the input

You can provide URLs for specific images you want to include. Simply insert the URLs into your content where you want each image to appear (see example below). You can also add instructions for how to display the images in additionalInstructions, eg, "Group the last 10 images into a gallery to showcase them together."

Note: If you want your gamma to use only the images you provide (and not generate additional ones), set imageOptions.source to noImages.

Token limits

The token limit is 100,000, which is approximately 400,000 characters. However, in some cases, the token limit may be lower, especially if your use case requires extra reasoning from our AI models. We highly recommend keeping inputText below 100,000 tokens and testing out a variety of inputs to get a good sense of what works for your use case.

Other tips

Text can be as little as a few words that describe the topic of the content you want to generate.
You can also input longer text -- pages of messy notes or highly structured, detailed text.
You can control where cards are split by adding \n---\n to the text.
You may need to apply JSON escaping to your text. Find out more about JSON escaping and try it out here.

Example : "inputText": "Ways to use AI for productivity"
Example : "inputText": "# The Final Frontier: Deep Sea Exploration\n* Less than 20% of our oceans have been explored\n* Deeper than 1,000 meters remains largely mysterious\n* More people have been to space than to the deepest parts of our ocean\n\nhttps://img.genially.com/5b34eda40057f90f3a45b977/1b02d693-2456-4379-a56d-4bc5e14c6ae1.jpeg\n---\n# Technological Breakthroughs\n* Advanced submersibles capable of withstanding extreme pressure\n* ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) with HD cameras and sampling tools\n* Autonomous underwater vehicles for extended mapping missions\n* Deep-sea communication networks enabling real-time data transmission\n\nhttps://images.encounteredu.com/excited-hare/production/uploads/subject-update-about-exploring-the-deep-hero.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1631569543&s=48f275c76c565fdaa5d4bd365246afd3\n---\n# Ecological Discoveries\n* Unique ecosystems thriving without sunlight\n* Hydrothermal vent communities using chemosynthesis\n* Creatures with remarkable adaptations: bioluminescence, pressure resistance\n* Thousands of new species discovered annually\n---\n# Scientific & Economic Value\n* Understanding climate regulation and carbon sequestration\n* Pharmaceutical potential from deep-sea organisms\n* Mineral resources and rare earth elements\n* Insights into extreme life that could exist on other planets\n\nhttps://publicinterestnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Western-Pacific-Jarvis_PD_NOAA-OER.jpg\n---\n# Future Horizons\n* Expansion of deep-sea protected areas\n* Sustainable exploration balancing discovery and conservation\n* Technological miniaturization enabling broader coverage\n* Citizen science initiatives through shared deep-sea data"


textMode (required)
Determines how your inputText is modified, if at all.

You can choose between generate, condense, or preserve
generate: Using your inputText as a starting point, Gamma will rewrite and expand the content. Works best when you have brief text in the input that you want to elaborate on.
condense: Gamma will summarize your inputText to fit the content length you want. Works best when you start with a large amount of text that you'd like to summarize.
preserve: Gamma will retain the exact text in inputText, sometimes structuring it where it makes sense to do so, eg, adding headings to sections. (If you do not want any modifications at all, you can specify this in the additionalInstructions parameter.)
Example : "textMode": "generate"

format (optional, defaults topresentation)
Determines the artifact Gamma will create for you.

You can choose between presentation, document, social, or webpage.
You can use the cardOptions.dimensionsfield to further specify the shape of your output.
Example : "format": "presentation"

themeId (optional, defaults to workspace default theme)
Defines which theme from Gamma will be used for the output. Themes determine the look and feel of the gamma, including colors and fonts.

You can use the GET Themes endpoint to pull a list of themes from your workspace. Or you can copy over the themeId from the app directly.
Example : "themeId": "abc123def456ghi"

numCards (optional, defaults to10)
Determines how many cards are created if auto is chosen in cardSplit

Pro users can choose any integer between 1 and 60.
Ultra users can choose any integer between 1 and 75.
Example

"numCards": 10

cardSplit (optional, defaults toauto)
Determines how your content will be divided into cards.

You can choose between auto or inputTextBreaks
Choosing auto tells Gamma to looks at the numCards field and divide up content accordingly. (It will not adhere to text breaks \n---\n in your inputText.)
Choosing inputTextBreaks tells Gamma that it should look for text breaks \n---\n in your inputText and divide the content based on this. (It will not respect numCards.)
Note: One \n---\n = one break, ie, text with one break will produce two cards, two break will produce three cards, and so on.
Here are some scenarios to guide your use of these parameters and explain how they work

additionalInstructions (optional)
Helps you add more specifications about your desired output.

You can add specifications to steer content, layouts, and other aspects of the output.
Works best when the instructions do not conflict with other parameters, eg, if the textMode is defined as condense, and the additionalInstructions say to preserve all text, the output will not be able to respect these conflicting requests.
Character limits: 1-2000.
Example

"additionalInstructions": "Make the card headings humorous and catchy"

folderIds (optional)
Defines which folder(s) your gamma is stored in.

You can use the GET Folders endpoint to pull a list of folders. Or you can copy over the folderIds from the app directly.


You must be a member of a folder to be able to add gammas to that folder.
Example

"folderIds": ["123abc456def", "456123abcdef"]

exportAs (optional)
Indicates if you'd like to return the generated gamma as a PDF or PPTX file as well as a Gamma URL.

Options are pdf or pptx
Download the files once generated as the links will become invalid after a period of time.
If you do not wish to directly export to a PDF or PPTX via the API, you may always do so later via the app.
Example

"exportAs": "pdf"

textOptions
textOptions.amount (optional, defaults tomedium)
Influences how much text each card contains. Relevant only if textMode is set to generate or condense.

You can choose between brief, medium, detailed or extensive
Example

"textOptions": {
    "amount": "detailed"
  }

textOptions.tone (optional)
Defines the mood or voice of the output. Relevant only if textMode is set to generate.

You can add one or multiple words to hone in on the mood/voice to convey.
Character limits: 1-500.
Example

"textOptions": {
    "tone": "neutral"
  }
Example

"textOptions": {
    "tone": "professional, upbeat, inspiring"
  }

textOptions.audience (optional)
Describes who will be reading/viewing the gamma, which allows Gamma to cater the output to the intended group. Relevant only if textMode is set to generate.

You can add one or multiple words to hone in on the intended viewers/readers of the gamma.
Character limits: 1-500.
Example

"textOptions": {
    "audience": "outdoors enthusiasts, adventure seekers"
  }
Example

"textOptions": {
    "audience": "seven year olds"
  }

textOptions.language (optional, defaults toen)
Determines the language in which your gamma is generated, regardless of the language of the inputText.

You can choose from the languages listed here.
Example

"textOptions": {
    "language": "en"
  }

imageOptions
imageOptions.source (optional, defaults toaiGenerated)
Determines where the images for the gamma are sourced from. You can choose from the options below. If you are providing your own image URLs in inputText and want only those to be used, set imageOptions.source to noImages to indicate that Gamma should not generate additional images.

Options for source	Notes
aiGenerated	If you choose this option, you can also specify the imageOptions.model you want to use as well as an imageOptions.style. These parameters do not apply to other source options.
pictographic	Pulls images from Pictographic.
unsplash	Gets images from Unsplash.
giphy	Gets GIFs from Giphy.
webAllImages	Pulls the most relevant images from the web, even if licensing is unknown.
webFreeToUse	Pulls images licensed for personal use.
webFreeToUseCommercially	Gets images licensed for commercial use, like a sales pitch.
placeholder	Creates a gamma with placeholders for which images can be manually added later.
noImages	Creates a gamma with no images. Select this option if you are providing your own image URLs in inputText and want only those in your gamma.

Example

"imageOptions": {
    "source": "aiGenerated"
  }

imageOptions.model (optional)
This field is relevant if the imageOptions.source chosen is aiGenerated. The imageOptions.model parameter determines which model is used to generate images.

You can choose from the models listed here.
If no value is specified for this parameter, Gamma automatically selects a model for you.
Example

"imageOptions": {
	"model": "flux-1-pro"
  }

imageOptions.style (optional)
This field is relevant if the imageOptions.source chosen is aiGenerated. The imageOptions.style parameter influences the artistic style of the images generated. While this is an optional field, we highly recommend adding some direction here to create images in a cohesive style.

You can add one or multiple words to define the visual style of the images you want.
Adding some direction -- even a simple one word like "photorealistic" -- can create visual consistency among the generated images.
Character limits: 1-500.
Example

"imageOptions": {
	"style": "minimal, black and white, line art"
  }

cardOptions
cardOptions.dimensions (optional)
Determines the aspect ratio of the cards to be generated. Fluid cards expand with your content. Not applicable if format is webpage.

Options if format is presentation: fluid (default), 16x9, 4x3
Options if format is document: fluid (default), pageless, letter, a4
Options if format is social: 1x1, 4x5(default) (good for Instagram posts and LinkedIn carousels), 9x16 (good for Instagram and TikTok stories)
Example

"cardOptions": {
  "dimensions": "16x9"
}

cardOptions.headerFooter (optional)
Allows you to specify elements in the header and footer of the cards. Not applicable if format is webpage.

Step 1: Pick which positions you want to populate. Options: topLeft, topRight, topCenter, bottomLeft, bottomRight, bottomCenter.
Step 2: For each position, specify what type of content goes there. Options: text, image, and cardNumber.
Step 3: Configure based on type.
For text, define a value (required)
For image:
Set the source. Options: themeLogo or customimage (required)
Set the size . Options:sm, md, lg, xl (optional)
For acustom image, define a src image URL (required)
For cardNumber, no additional configuration is available.
Step 4: For any position, you can control whether it appears on the first or last card:
hideFromFirstCard (optional) - Set to true to hide from first card. Default: false
hideFromLastCard (optional) - Set to true to hide from last card. Default: false
Example

"cardOptions": {
    "headerFooter": {
      "topRight": {
        "type": "image",
        "source": "themeLogo",
        "size": "sm"
      },
      "bottomRight": {

Top level parameters
gammaId (required)
Identifies the template you want to modify. You can find and copy the gammaId for a template as shown in the screenshots below.





prompt (required)
Use this parameter to send text content, image URLs, as well as instructions for how to use this content in relation to the template gamma.

Add images to the input

You can provide URLs for specific images you want to include. Simply insert the URLs into your content where you want each image to appear (see example below). You can also add instructions for how to display the images, eg, "Group the last 10 images into a gallery to showcase them together."

Token limits

The total token limit is 100,000, which is approximately 400,000 characters, but because part of your input is the gamma template, in practice, the token limit for your prompt becomes shorter. We highly recommend keeping your prompt well below 100,000 tokens and testing out a variety of inputs to get a good sense of what works for your use case.

Other tips

Text can be as little as a few words that describe the topic of the content you want to generate.
You can also input longer text -- pages of messy notes or highly structured, detailed text.
You may need to apply JSON escaping to your text. Find out more about JSON escaping and try it out here.
Example

"prompt": "Change this pitch deck about deep sea exploration into one about space exploration."
Example

"prompt": "Change this pitch deck about deep sea exploration into one about space exploration. Use this quote and this image in the title card: That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind - Neil Armstrong, https://www.global-aero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ga-iss.jpg"

themeId (optional, defaults to the template's theme)
Defines which theme from Gamma will be used for the output. Themes determine the look and feel of the gamma, including colors and fonts.

You can use the GET Themes endpoint to pull a list of themes from your workspace. Or you can copy over the themeId from the app directly.

Example

"themeId": "abc123def456ghi"

folderIds (optional)
Defines which folder(s) your gamma is stored in.

You can use the GET Folders endpoint to pull a list of folders. Or you can copy over the folderIds from the app directly.


You must be a member of a folder to be able to add gammas to that folder.
Example

"folderIds": ["123abc456", "def456789"]

exportAs (optional)
Indicates if you'd like to return the generated gamma as a PDF or PPTX file as well as a Gamma URL.

Options are pdf or pptx
Download the files once generated as the links will become invalid after a period of time.
If you do not wish to directly export to a PDF or PPTX via the API, you may always do so later via the app.
Example

"exportAs": "pdf"

imageOptions
When you create content from a Gamma template, new images automatically match the image source used in the original template. For example if you used Pictographic images to generate your original template, any new images will be sourced from Pictographic.

For templates with AI-generated images, you can override the default AI image settings using the optional parameters below.

imageOptions.model (optional)
This field is relevant if the original template was created using AI generated images. The imageOptions.model parameter determines which model is used to generate new images.

You can choose from the models listed here.
If no value is specified for this parameter, Gamma automatically selects a model for you.
Example

"imageOptions": {
	"model": "flux-1-pro"
  }

imageOptions.style (optional)
This field is relevant if the original template was created using AI generated images. The imageOptions.style parameter influences the artistic style of the images generated.

You can add one or multiple words to define the visual style of the images you want.
Adding some direction -- even a simple one word like "photorealistic" -- can create visual consistency among the generated images.
Character limits: 1-500.
Example

"imageOptions": {
	"style": "minimal, black and white, line art"
  }

sharingOptions
sharingOptions.workspaceAccess (optional, defaults to workspace share settings)
Determines level of access members in your workspace will have to your generated gamma.

Options are: noAccess, view, comment, edit, fullAccess
fullAccessallows members from your workspace to view, comment, edit, and share with others.
Example

"sharingOptions": {
	"workspaceAccess": "comment"
}

sharingOptions.externalAccess (optional, defaults to workspace share settings)
Determines level of access members outside your workspace will have to your generated gamma.

Options are: noAccess, view, comment, or edit
Example

"sharingOptions": {
	"externalAccess": "noAccess"
}

sharingOptions.emailOptions (optional)
sharingOptions.emailOptions.recipients (optional)
Allows users to share gamma with specific recipients via their email.

Example

"sharingOptions": {
  "emailOptions": {
    "recipients": ["ceo@example.com", "cto@example.com"]
}
sharingOptions.emailOptions.access (optional)
Determines level of access users defined in sharingOptions.emailOptions.recipients have to your generated gamma.

Options are: view, comment, edit, or fullAccess
Example

"sharingOptions": {
  "emailOptions": {
    "access": "comment"
}

List Themes and List Folders APIs explained
List API methods support bulk fetching through cursor-based pagination. You can list folders with GET /v1.0/folders and list themes with GET /v1.0/themes. These endpoints share a common structure and accept the same pagination parameters.

All list endpoints accept the following parameters

Parameter	Type	Description
query	string (optional)	Search by name (case-insensitive). Filters results to items matching the search term.
limit	integer (optional)	Number of items to return per page. Maximum: 50.
after	string (optional)	Cursor token for fetching the next page. Use the nextCursor value from the previous response.
List response format

Field	Type	Description
data	array	Array of folder or theme objects.
hasMore	boolean	Indicates whether more pages exist. When true, use nextCursor to fetch the next page.
nextCursor	string or null	Opaque cursor token for the next page. Pass this value to the after parameter in your next request. Returns null on the last page.

List Themes
Returns a paginated list of the themes in the your workspace. This endpoint returns both workspace-specific and global themes in a single response, filterable via the type field.

GET Themes

curl -X GET https://public-api.gamma.app/v1.0/themes \
-H "X-API-KEY: sk-gamma-xxxxxxxx"
Themes response

Each theme object in the data array contains:

Sample response

{
  "id": "abcdefghi",
  "name": "Prism",
  "type": "custom",
  "colorKeywords": ["light","blue","pink","purple","pastel","gradient","vibrant"],
  "toneKeywords": ["playful","friendly","creative","inspirational","fun"]
}
The type field distinguishes between:

standard: Global themes available to all workspaces
custom: Workspace-specific themes

List Folders
Returns a paginated list of the folders in your workspace.

GET Folders

curl -X GET https://public-api.gamma.app/v1.0/folders \
-H "X-API-KEY: sk-gamma-xxxxxxxx"
Folders response

Each folder object in the data array contains:

Sample response

{
  "id": "abc123def456",
  "name": "Business Proposals"
}

Pagination Example: Fetch all folders
The example below is for fetching folders but also applies to listing themes.

Get first page of folders

Request 1

GET /v1.0/folders?limit=50
Response 1

{
  "data": [
    { "id": "abcdef", "name": "Design" },
    { "id": "xyzabc", "name": "Marketing" }
  ],
  "hasMore": true,
  "nextCursor": "abc123def456ghi789"
}
Get additional folders

The after parameter accepts a cursor string from a previous response to fetch the next page of results. Cursors are always forward-only—you cannot paginate backward through results.
When hasMore is false and nextCursor is null, you've reached the end of the results.
Request 2

GET /v1.0/folders?limit=50&after=abc123def456ghi789
Response 2

{
  "data": [
    { "id": "lmnop1", "name": "Sales" },
    { "id": "qrstuv", "name": "Product" }
  ],
  "hasMore": false,
  "nextCursor": "null"
}

Query Example: Search for a theme
The example below shows how to search for a theme by name, and also applies to searching for folders.

Search for themes with "dark" in the name

Request

GET /v1.0/themes?query=dark&limit=50
Response

{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "abc123def456",
      "name": "Standard Dark",
      "type": "standard",
      "colorKeywords": ["black", "gray", "accent"],
      "toneKeywords": ["sophisticated", "modern"]
    },
    {
      "id": "123abc456def",
      "name": "Dark Gradient",
      "type": "custom",
      "colorKeywords": ["purple", "black", "navy"],
      "toneKeywords": ["dramatic", "elegant"]
    }
  ],
  "hasMore": false,
  "nextCursor": "null"
}
The returned id can be used in the themeId parameter in the Generate and Create from Template APIs.
